TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================================

Based on the mathematical model from:
'The Opportunity Cost of Patriarchy: A Quantitative Analysis
of Civilisational Inefficiency'

MODEL PARAMETERS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Patriarchal innovation rate: 15% of potential
Egalitarian innovation rate: 100% of potential
Analysis period: -3000 to 2026

KEY FINDINGS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Current year (calendar): 2026 CE
Technological lag: 2500 years (from paper estimate)
Egalitarian equivalent year: 4526 CE
Years of lost advancement: 2500

INTERPRETATION:
------------------------------------------------------------
In 2026 under patriarchal conditions, our technological development
is equivalent to what the year ~-474 CE would have been
in an egalitarian scenario (approximately 2,500 years behind).

Conversely, if we had maintained gender equity throughout history,
our current (2026) development level would be equivalent to the
year 4526 CE - approximately 2500 years
more advanced than we currently are.

This represents a ~85.0% reduction in development rate due to
systematic gender-based exclusion from innovation processes.

CUMULATIVE OPPORTUNITY COST:
------------------------------------------------------------
Total lost development: 1872.33 units
Lost development as % of potential: 85.0%
Efficiency ratio (actual/potential): 15.04%
